# Appsembler Issues
- Students can't save their progress
- costs $
- Degrading experience as more users work concurrently

# Google Colab option
- IP is safe as we keep link in student-only area in Mattermost app
- Students can save progress
- No degrading experience as more users work concurrently
- Free
- Issue: Grading is an open question

# [Student User Experience](https://youtu.be/R6HpU5Cj1W8)
- Open: click on a link to assignment in mattermost --> Open with Colab
- Save: File --> Download .ipynb or Save a copy to Drive
- Restart: upload file or open from Drive to restart from previous place
- Grade(?)
